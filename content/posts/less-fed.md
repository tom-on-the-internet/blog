I'm overfed.

## The Problem

I have an input problem. I take in too much input, and I seek out more input when I don't need it.

Input is **food**. Input is **tweets**. Input is **podcasts**. Input is things I enjoy, but having too much of them makes me feel worse.

But I'm addicted, and these inputs have **feeds**.

Feeds are a way of providing input whether or not I need it.

For food, it's meals and snacks. I find myself eating because it's time to eat, or because I like how eating makes me feel, but not because I'm hungry.

For online feeds, such as Twitter or Reddit, I find myself grazing all day. At the end of the a feed, I can hardly remember what I saw. It doesn't feel good.

## The Cure

I want to be less fed. I still want to eat, but not be a slave to my addiction. I still want to read tweets, but only when it makes sense, not automatically.

## List of feeds in my life

1. Meals

   I will try to eat less food, fewer times. I'm aiming for one meal a day. I'm going to try to only drink water.

1. Twitter

   Bye Twitter. I'll unfollow everyone except friends (so that they can message me.) I'll only visit Twitter if I'm sent a tweet.

1. Reddit

   Same as Twitter, mostly. Log out. Only log in to post things. However, it _is_ valuable for me to see the top posts in subreddits I have joined. I can occasionally check in to look at the top posts of the month. This is where I read about relevant tech news.

1. Facebook

   I don't spend much time on Facebook. I'll keep Messenger so I can message my family.

1. YouTube

   YouTube is a surprising drain. I watch a lot of videos. I'll unsubscribe from everyone and try to avoid the site unless someone tells me to watch something.

1. Email

   I need email on my phone, but I will remove notifications.

## How I'll spend my time

Ideally I'll spend my time less distracted. I'll focus more on my family and the goals I have. I'll read/watch things that make me happy afterwards.

When I'm at home, I'm going to leave my phone in my room or in my office. It doesn't need to go with me everywhere in the house.
