On Saturday (2019-01-12), I posted [Hack](https://tomontheinternet.com/blog/hack-game), a game for web developers, on Reddit. For a few hours, it was the top post on the /r/webdev subreddit. ([post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/af6y4n/show_off_saturday_hack_a_browser_hacking_game_for/))

## What's the big deal?

To me, it was a big deal. A little game I made in my free time was enjoyed by hundreds of other web developers. This was the first time I put anything substantial out there, and it was well received.

The response made me feel great. So many people said that they enjoyed the game and thanked me for taking the time to make it.

## Surprises

I was surprised by how many people got in touch to ask me questions about how the game works and how the levels were supposed to be solved. I haven't been a developer for that long and like most developers I have some imposter syndrome to deal with. Still, here I was, the authority on how browsers worked and how to explore the hidden side of websites.

Another surprise was all the interesting ways that people solved the game. Turns out there are a lot of talented developers out there.

Finally, I was (pleasantly) surprised by how kind everyone was. 

## What's next?

Not sure. I may expand upon the game at some point. It's fun to work on. We'll see!
