title: Bye Gatsby! Hi Hugo!

I moved my blog from Gatsby to Hugo. I wouldn't be writing about this if the move went poorly.

## Why I chose Gatsby

I initially chose Gatsby because it promised a lot:

- Extremely fast page loads.
- Image optimization.
- Sever rendered templates, but with React on top.
- A plugin for everything.

I was happy with Gatsby at first, but...

## Gatsby was a bad choice for me

The first issue I had with Gatsby was that it uses GraphQL to fetch data, even locally. This was a confusing way of accessing my data and not a pattern I felt like learning for my tiny blog.

Next, build times were slow, even for a very small blog.

But the biggest problem was that I had to babysit my blog. Gatsby would regularly update and I found my blog no longer worked. By the end, I couldn't get my blog to build and I wasn't interested in spending time figuring out how to fix it.

Ultimately, Gatsby requires maintenance. This is fine if your site is updated often, but for a site like mine that is rarely updated, Gatsby is a headache.

## Why I moved to Hugo

Hugo is fast to build.

Hugo is simple.

I thought I would look at Hugo for a few minutes to understand how it works, and 30 minutes later I had my blog fully moved over and deployed. Easy.

## So, is Hugo better than Gatsby?

For me, yes. For you? Maybe.

Gatsby shines (I presume) for professional sites. Your company's landing page might be a good candidate for Gatsby. But for my little blog? It was a headache.
