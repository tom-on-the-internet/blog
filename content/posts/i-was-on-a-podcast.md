In December, I [wrote a blog post](../taming-the-terminal) about a podcast I liked. The host of the podcast reached out, and [invited me on her podcast](https://www.podfeet.com/blog/2020/02/ccatp-625/). I had a great time.

The podcast went through my experience of becoming a developer. Allison, the host, did a great job of making it conversational while keeping me on the rails.

It was my first time being on a podcast. After listening to them for so many years, it was nice to be on the other side of the microphone. I didn't come off as badly as I expected. My wife says I sounded pretty good.

I want to do more podcasts in the future, about technology. I love talking about technology, especially when it gets into the details.
